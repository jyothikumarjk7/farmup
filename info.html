        <p style="color:white;font-size:25pt">The decayed fruits and vegetables can be converted into manure which can again 
            be given to farmers which they can use as a manure for their field.This process 
            is called composting.></p>
        <p style="color:white;font-size:50pt">HOW TO DO THIS?</p>
        <p style="color:white;font-size:25pt"><br>1.Collect decayed vegetable peels and fruits.</br>
2.Now collect some dry organic matter like dried leaves, sawdust, and wood ash .
<br>3.Take a big container  and drill 4 5 holes around the container at different levels to let air inside.</br>
4.Now fill the bottom of the container with a layer of soil.
<br>5.Now start adding decayed fruits and vegetables  in layers alternating wet waste with dry waste (straw, sawdust, dried leaves).</br>
6.Cover this container with a plastic sheet or a plank of wood to help retain moisture and heat.
<br>7.Check the container every few days and if you think the pile is too dry, sprinkle some water so that it is moist.</br>
8.After few days manure will be produced which can be used by farmers for the crops hence saves money.</br></p>
